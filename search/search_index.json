The Keycloak Identity Management System is used as an OAuth 2.0 server to secure the application.</p> <p>IMPORTANT:</p> <p>Frontend application uses the front-channel to login with Keycloak. Backend microservices use the back-channel to validate auth tokens.</p> <p>To use the same host name for both scenarios,  add the host name <code>keycloak</code> to <code>/etc/hosts</code> file pointing to <code>127.0.0.1</code>.</p> <p><code>127.0.0.1         keycloak</code> </p> <p>Task is a task runner that we can use to run any arbitrary commands in an easier way.</p> <p>Install Task CLI.</p> <pre><code>$ brew install go-task\n(or)\n$ go install github.com/go-task/task/v3/cmd/task@latest\n\n#verify task version\n$ task --version\nTask version: 3.35.1\n</code></pre> <p>Now, you can run the application locally using docker-compose as follows:</p> <pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/feature-tracker/docker-infra.git\n$ cd docker-infra\n$ task start\n</code></pre> <p>You can access the Feature Tracker application at http://localhost:4200</p>"},{"location":"#local-development","title":"Local Development","text":"<p>1.Clone the repositories</p> <pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/feature-tracker/docker-infra.git\n$ git clone https://github.com/feature-tracker/api-gateway.git\n$ git clone https://github.com/feature-tracker/config-server.git\n$ git clone https://github.com/feature-tracker/feature-service.git\n$ git clone https://github.com/feature-tracker/notification-service.git\n$ git clone https://github.com/feature-tracker/user-service.git\n$ git clone https://github.com/feature-tracker/feature-tracker-angular.git\n</code></pre> <p>Alternatively, you can use IntelliJ IDEA Workspace support to clone all the repositories easily.</p> <p>First, install Multi-Project Workspace Plugin if you haven't already installed.</p> <p>From IntelliJ IDEA, clone the ft-workspace repository (https://github.com/feature-tracker/ft-workspace) which will automatically clone all the required Git repositories.</p> <p>2.
