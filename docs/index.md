# Feature Tracker
The feature tracker application will serve as a centralized hub for product development teams and users 
to monitor the implementation status of features across multiple products, track their release cycles, 
and identify areas for improvement. Additionally, user feedback will be collected and analyzed to provide 
actionable insights on which features are most well-received by users.
